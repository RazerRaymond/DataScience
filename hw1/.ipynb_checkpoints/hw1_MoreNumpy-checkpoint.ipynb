They are having a major problem with customer retention in their wireless business. In the mid-Atlantic region, 20% of cell phone customers leave when their contracts expire, and it is getting increasingly difficult to acquire new customers. Since the cell phone market is now saturated, the huge growth in the wireless market has tapered off. Communications companies are now engaged in battles to attract each other’s customers while retaining their own. Customers switching from one company to another is called churn, and it is expensive all around: one company must spend on incentives to attract a customer while another company loses revenue when the customer departs.\n",
    "You have been called in to help understand the problem and to devise a solution. Attracting new customers is much more expensive than retaining existing ones, so a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn. Marketing has already designed a special retention offer. Your task is to devise a precise, step-by-step plan for how the data science team should use MegaTelCo’s vast data resources to decide which customers should be offered the special retention deal prior to the expiration of their contracts.*\n",

I might also need the help of machine learning to design and revise the retention offer patterns.

If the user is the group owner/starter of a group, will he or she sent more message to others compare to other non-owner members? Does this chatting overlapping with their  working time or not? This will help me understand if they are using DataSciencesters effectively under a leader or group owner. I might also need the help of machine learning to design and revise the predicting model. If there is no clear relation between the variable i am investigating, I can go back and reidentify the problem and revise my assumption and redo all the steps to find a new method to check the new \"key connector\".
